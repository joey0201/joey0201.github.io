    <h1>City University of Hong Kong</h1>
    <h2>History</h2>
    
    <p>City University's origins lie in the calls for a "second polytechnic" in the years following the 1972 establishment of the Hong Kong Polytechnic. In 1982, Executive Council member Chung Sze-yuen spoke of a general consensus that "a second polytechnic of similar size to the first should be built as soon as possible."[3] District administrators from Tuen Mun and Tsuen Wan lobbied the government to build the new institution in their respective new towns.[3] The government instead purchased temporary premises at the new Argyle Centre Tower II in Mong Kok, a property developed by the Mass Transit Railway Corporation in concert with the then-Argyle station. The new school was called City Polytechnic of Hong Kong, a name chosen among nearly 300 suggestions made by members of the public.[4]</p>

    <p>The new polytechnic opened on 8 October 1984, welcoming 480 full-time and 680 part-time students.[5] The provision for part-time students contributed to high enrolment, with the quota being filled almost immediately.[5]</p>
    
    <p>A tract of land on the former site of a village named Chu Koo Chai [yue] was chosen for the new campus.[6] The architectural contract to design the campus was won by Percy Thomas Partnership in association with Alan Fitch and W.N. Chung.[7] It was originally slated to open by October 1988.[8] The first phase was officially opened by Governor Wilson on 15 January 1990, and boasted 14 lecture theatres and 1,500 computers.[9] By 1991, the school had over 8,000 full-time students and approximately 3,000 part-time students.[10] The second phase of the permanent campus opened 1993.[7]</p>
    
    <blockquote>The school achieved university status in 1994 and the name was changed accordingly.[11]</blockquote>
    
    <p>In <strong>2023</strong>, to welcome the start of the new academic year, <em>CityU</em> has launched CityU Heroes, stories about our outstanding alumni, students and faculty that demonstrate our determination to pursue academic excellence and illustrate how to realise their dreams and give back to society through learning-centric pedagogy. The tunnel connecting the CityU campus to Festival Walk proudly champions the stories of the CityU Heroes.
